          <p className="about_rap">It was all a dream, I used to read PC Magazine, Brendan Eich and Berners-Lee up in the tech scene.
          Hanging wireframes on the wall, every Saturday on my Mac, creating magic, big and small.
          <br/>
          I let my Git rock til my brand popped
          working at the Iron Yard, trying to rise like a stock.
          Way back, when I had that corporate job that was wack,
          that was when I took a step back.
          Money was the mission, happiness was missin.
          So I took a detour, while many kept on dissin.
          <br/>
          Now I'm in the limelight, because I code right.
          Time to get paid, and show off what I made.
          I made a change from the common goof,
          now I'm a programmer and I got the proof.
          <br/>
          I never thought it would happen that way, but as they say,
          don't be in your own way.
          Don't regret it, it can change if you let it,
          Never look back and don't let others take the credit.
          <br/>
          This is where I am, this is where I want to be,
          thanks for reading, stay tuned and see!
